The art gallery was to display artwork created by members of YWCA to tell the experiences theyâ€™ve encountered. The branding guide was created to lead the rest of the class in their final deliverables; therefore, the language and feeling of the gallery was to be strong, yet sensitive.","results":"This branding guide was created prior to any artwork; therefore, it was difficult to gauge the color and feeling behind the majority of the artwork. Regardless, the feedback and excitement from YWCA were very positive.","role1":"Branding","role2":"Designer","role3":"Team Lead","title":"YWCA of Greater Lafayette","year":2019,"featuredImage":{"publicURL":"/static/5b3ff38813ff53ccbf86ea7d0fe86197/ywca_mockup.jpg"},"image1":{"publicURL":"/static/ac8b17f97132f24f1aafab1649795552/ywca_home.png"},"image2":{"publicURL":"/static/df6132d004af99bc7032fd22bf342ba5/ywca_mood.png"},"image3":{"publicURL":"/static/09c1f538b38b3ad9797350676b899ba9/ywca_principles.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ywca/"}}}
