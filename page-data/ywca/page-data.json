The art gallery was to display artwork created by members of YWCA to tell the experiences theyâ€™ve encountered and overcome. The guide was created to lead the rest of the class in their final deliverables; therefore, the language and feeling of the gallery was to be strong, yet sensitive. I and another classmate collaborated in creating an outline for our branding strategies.","approach":"We wanted the focus to be the artwork; therefore, we went with simplistic colors and fonts. I created the branding guide in Adobe Illustrator and distributed it to the whole class by providing the booklet and links to the Google Fonts utilized.","results":"This branding guide took two weeks of consistent work to complete and was created prior to any artwork. Therefore, it was difficult to gauge the color and feeling behind the majority of the artwork. Regardless, the feedback and excitement from YWCA were very positive and they were excited to begin utilizing it.","role1":"Branding","role2":"Designer","role3":"Team Lead","title":"YWCA of Greater Lafayette","year":2019,"featuredImage":{"publicURL":"/static/5b3ff38813ff53ccbf86ea7d0fe86197/ywca_mockup.jpg"},"image1":{"publicURL":"/static/29e000a942cf0408d9307376fb549b08/ywca-front.jpg"},"image2":{"publicURL":"/static/da7821c3d41b7a897a8c55b2801ad992/ywca-other.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ywca/"}}}
