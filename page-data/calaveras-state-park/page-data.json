My team and I chose to recreate a California state park with a newer, modern design. As state and national parks in the United States have a simplistic, consistent appearance across all parks, we wanted to create a more specialized experience to attract visitors. We wanted to provide a unique experience to visitors where they could observe photos of their destination as well as factual information.","approach":"This project was created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. My teammates conducted research on the content of the site and established the web copy. I collaborated with them on the design of the site and took up most of the development work. We tested the site and received feedback from users within our class and updated some spacing to accommodate for multiple screens per their responses.","results":"This project from conception to completion took a little less than a month to complete. This site met all evaluation criteria in fields relating to 508 compliance, aesthetics, and development; therefore, we received a high grade. In the future, I believe this site could easily be turned into a public template that can expand to fit othersâ€™ needs.","role1":"Designer","role2":"Developer","role3":"Team Lead","title":"Calaveras State Park","year":2019,"featuredImage":{"publicURL":"/static/ed5883ecda490e10819367f6a25d41d1/calaveras_phone_mockup.jpg"},"image1":{"publicURL":"/static/d258e92e0f4cded3ad9f7c91373d6e72/calaveras-home.jpg"},"image2":{"publicURL":"/static/60c94de169c229048e1f5c2dbdba1313/calaveras-other.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/calaveras-state-park/"}}}
