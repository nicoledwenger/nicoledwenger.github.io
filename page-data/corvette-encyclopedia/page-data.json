As a budding car enthusiast, I was inspired to create a site that balanced design and technical information without being too overwhelming. My overall objective was to create a different take on traditional wiki sites. When researching the different generations of Corvettes, it was overwhelming how much text was presented. Often images were very small and the sites appeared dull and out of date. Therefore, I wanted to have a more modern appearance.","approach":"As part of the assignment, we were required to utilizing HTML, CSS, and jQuery to build the sites. This site was built custom utilizing front end languages.","results":"From design to development, this site took a little less than a month to complete. This site met all evaluation criteria in fields relating to 508 compliancy, aesthetics, and development; therefore, I received a high grade for my achievements. Later on, I would like to create a more interactive and scalable site utilizing React and APIs.","role1":"Designer","role2":"Developer","role3":"Researcher","title":"Chevrolet Corvette Encyclopedia","year":2019,"featuredImage":{"publicURL":"/static/9e93f891a7c67ab30c80e36694587a22/corvette_mobile_mockup.jpg"},"image1":{"publicURL":"/static/f7856587e02ba754b5ffed5bcea012b8/corvette-home.jpg"},"image2":{"publicURL":"/static/81f92e3407ec4e5fa207c20f00f0c89d/corvette-other.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/corvette-encyclopedia/"}}}
