The intentions of this redesign focused on recruiting more Big volunteers for the organization through bold fonts, colors, and strong language. A large portion of the redesign centered around new navigation and language development to emphasize the importance of a Big/Little pairing for BBBS.","results":"In comparison to the current site design, the results of this redesign align with the larger organizationâ€™s branding.
