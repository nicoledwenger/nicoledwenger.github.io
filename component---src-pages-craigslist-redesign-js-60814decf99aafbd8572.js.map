     Craigslist is an eCommerce site that has remained largely unchanged since its launch in 1996. For CGT 256 - Principles of UXD at\n                Purdue University, my team and I were tasked to discover and design improvements for Craigslist. By conducting a trends review, competitor reviews, interface inventory, and hueristic evaluation, we were able to discover shortcomings of Craigslist and how to appeal to a younger audience. \n              </Paragraph>\n              <Paragraph>\n                The second part of this project was to conduct usability testing on Craigslist and discover if it's efficient, effective, and enjoyable for our target audience. Once this testing was completed, we analyzed results and compared it to our redesign.\n              </Paragraph>\n              <Paragraph>\n                <strong>The Goal</strong>\n                <br />\n                The goal of this project is to conduct an evaluation of Craigslist and redesign it utilizing visual\ndesign and usability principles to improve upon a dated style. The redesign needed to account\nfor old features to not alienate their current user-group while also expanding into a younger\naudience. Once the first part was completed, we were tasked to test the real Craigslist for efficiency, effectiveness, and enjoyment and compare sentiments against our redesign.\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Container>\n          </ProjectContainer>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n\n      <ImageContainer>\n        <Img\n          fluid={data.icons.childImageSharp.fluid}\n          alt=\"User experience design icons\"\n        />\n      </ImageContainer>\n\n      <Layout>\n        <div>\n          <ProjectContainer>\n            <Container>\n              <WorkSubHeading>discover & explore</WorkSubHeading>\n            </Container>\n\n            <Container>\n              <Paragraph>\n                Before ideating and coming up with a redesign, we needed to research the current market, trends, competitors, and analyze what features Craigslist has and how they function.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                From the secondary research conducted, a few things could be easily taken into account from\neBay for Craigslist. The UI definitely needs an upgrade from color to filter options. The site also\nneeds to implement better customer service and shipping protection. The items on craigslist\nneed to be categorized and sorted in a much way better way.\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Container>\n          </ProjectContainer>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n\n      <ImageContainer>\n        <Img\n          fluid={data.moodboard.childImageSharp.fluid}\n          style={{ boxShadow: \"0px 4px 10px 0 #dedede\" }}\n          alt={`${project.projectName} moodboard`}\n        />\n      </ImageContainer>\n\n      <Layout>\n        <div>\n          <ProjectContainer>\n            <Container>\n              <WorkSubHeading>Ideate & Design</WorkSubHeading>\n            </Container>\n\n            <Container>\n              <Paragraph>\n              The purpose of a mood board is to represent the feel for the visual design direction. Their\nintent is to be an effective way to communicate big design ideas. To carry out our mood boards,\nthree members of our team individually created mood boards for Craigslist redesign. These\nmood boards contain our proto-persona, representative images of our user group, the\ninspiration of design and layouts, and any graphic information. These moodboards can be found in our design documentation linked above.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                After we presented our three moodboards, we created a style guide to direct our mockups. From our moodboards, we decided there were important features for our mockup to have.\n              </Paragraph>\n              <ul style={{ fontFamily: \"Lato\" }}>\n                <li>\n                A soft, not sterile design with rounded edges and light drop shadows\n                </li>\n                <li>Relateable and simplistic typography with various weight styles for visual hierarchy</li>\n                <li>\n                 Added white space to the overall grid system\n                </li>\n                <li>Reach out to seller page with the option to leave a review</li>\n                <li>Breakdown large navigation headings with sub-navigation</li>\n                  <li>Making it casual and staying away from sterile, linear designs</li>\n              </ul>\n            </Container>\n          </ProjectContainer>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n\n      <ImageContainer>\n        <Img\n          fluid={data.homePage.childImageSharp.fluid}\n          style={{ boxShadow: \"0px 4px 10px 0 #dedede\" }}\n          alt={`${project.projectName} style guide`}\n        />\n      </ImageContainer>\n\n      <Layout>\n        <div>\n          <ProjectContainer>\n            <Container>\n              <WorkSubHeading>prototype & test</WorkSubHeading>\n            </Container>\n\n            <Container>\n              <Paragraph>\n                To test our mockups, we conducted desirability testing. The testing conducted by our team included a Google Forms questionnaire. It included a 7\nquestion portion over dyadic word associations. These included the following: complex vs.\nsimple; confusing vs. clear; clean vs. cluttered; professional vs. unprofessional; attractive vs.\nunattractive; modern vs. outdated; and organized vs. unorganized. We conducted these same\nquestions on both our new redesign and the existing Craigslist site. The next portion of our\ntesting was a qualitative questionnaire including questions about how the user would use the\nsite or their perceived ability to use the site and rating these perceptions on a scale from 1-5\nfor both the redesign and current site. We next conducted an open-ended opinion response\nquestionnaire. This allowed the participants to let us know in their own words how they feel\nabout using the site. We included questions about their mood, frustrations, and ease of use\nwhilst looking at both sites.\n              </Paragraph>\n              <Paragraph>\n              From our results we noticed that it seems that the old version was perceived\nclearer than the redesign, but all other markers were improved in the new design.\nFrom the qualitative questionnaire, the values of the perception of usability were much higher\nin the redesign than the current version. From the open-ended response questions, we received\n“calm” and “innovative” as recurring responses to the new site.\n              </Paragraph>\n            </Container>\n          </ProjectContainer>\n        </div>\n      </Layout>\n\n      <ImageContainer>\n        <Img\n          fluid={data.otherPage.childImageSharp.fluid}\n          style={{ boxShadow: \"0px 4px 10px 0 #dedede\" }}\n          alt={`${project.projectName} mockup`}\n        />\n      </ImageContainer>\n\n      <Layout>\n        <div>\n          <ProjectContainer>\n            <Container>\n              <WorkSubHeading>lessons learned</WorkSubHeading>\n            </Container>\n\n            <Container>\n              <ul style={{ fontFamily: \"Lato\" }}>\n                <li>\n                  <strong>Know the audience.</strong> Craigslist had an already dedicated audience for a reason.
